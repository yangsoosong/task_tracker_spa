# TaskTracker 3
Design Choices:
We have two resources - user and task. User has_many tasks whereas user has to have a name. Tasks must hae name, desc and time(which is 15 interveral). We can complete task by clicking complete button on card. User's name appears when they login. You get error message when inputting wrong info about your account.
  
To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
